## Key Points & Takeaways

- The team verified the **application taxonomy and contacts**; accuracy is critical because taxonomy drives approvals, test eligibility, and compliance reporting.
- **TRAP recertification requires two approvals** (Plan Manager and Application Owner). Incorrect role setup can misroute approvals and force a restart.
- **Starting in 2026**, every application must certify **two TRAPs annually**:
  - Application Recovery TRAP  
  - **Cyber Recovery TRAP** (more complex and mandatory)
- **Cyber Recovery TRAP** assumes a full disaster scenario (bare-metal rebuild), including infrastructure rebuild, upstream/downstream dependency recovery, and application testing.
- **Resiliency test types are determined by taxonomy**. Cloud assets require **CSP (Cloud Service Provider) tests**, which are separate from SR/DR tests.
- **CSP tests are required immediately for cloud usage**—there is no grace period. Missing CSP tests create an instant compliance gap.
- Compliance gaps are reflected in **enterprise and cloud heat maps** and are captured in **month-end metrics**, with visibility to senior leadership.
- Older **manual external cloud test placeholders are no longer required**; CSP tests now replace them.
- Teams should **schedule CSP tests early and provide change numbers** to minimize compliance risk and scrutiny.
- CT-Resiliency provides **templates and guides** to help teams complete SR and CSP testing.
